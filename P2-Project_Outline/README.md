# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Meet Up Voting Site
This will be a site where a user can create an event with options on location and time, invite attendees to log in and vote, and once the results are in, the original user can email a link to view results to attendees. This can be for personal or professional use, and would solve the constant problem of, "Well, what did you have in mind? Nothing?"

My husband and I are forever indecisive, so trying to coordinate a social outing with us as a couple can be really frustrating. This was the spark for the idea.

### Features
Log In, Log Out
Create Group/Create Poll and invite participants/Create Event with Participants and Choices
Results can be accessed via sharable link (either MailTo or variation from work)

### Technologies
Java
SpringBoot
MySQL
Thymeleaf

### What I'll Have to Learn
I want to learn Sass and more Bootstrap to make my styles really stand out.
I will have to learn more Spring Boot, for example, to implement CI/CD
I will have to learn more about JDBC API for object-relational mapping, to expand on Chapter 17 from Unit 2
